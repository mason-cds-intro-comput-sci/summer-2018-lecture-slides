.valign-slide[
* Arrive at Research Hall 249 for your designated time slot (schedule available on Slack)

* Upon arrival, wait outside until you are asked to enter

  * I may still be meeting with another student

  * I need a couple minutes to reset things after each student leaves

* You do not need to bring anything with you

# Overview of final interview

.font90[
* Final interview is structured to be 10 minutes in length, with 2 extra minutes for a buffer

  * Will be enforced using a timer

* This is loosely modeled after "code interviews" that some employers include in their interview process

* Your objective will be to demonstrate that you can complete tasks similar to what we've practiced during the semester in order to answer simple questions

* When you enter the room, I will hand you a sheet with questions that I want you to answer

* You will be provided with a computer (my laptop) logged into RStudio Server, and printed versions of the RStudio cheat sheets that you can consult at any time while answering the questions

* You may also use R's documentation (running `?geom_histogram` for example)

* You must stay on the RStudio Server page the entire time, meaning you cannot perform internet searches

# Overview of final interview

* Questions will ask you to manipulate data in some way (transformation, filtering, aggregation) and also to visualize it

* **Grading**

  * You begin the interview with a 100%, to keep it you need to answer the questions within the alloted time

  * I will provide hints if you get stuck at different parts of a question, however hints lower your score

  * The more hints I need to give you (or the larger those hints are), the more points that I deduct

  * Not finishing all the questions in the alloted time will also deduct points

# Overview of final interview

* Be familiar with the primary functions we learned for `ggplot2` and `dplyr`!

  * For `dplyr`, this includes `filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()` and `summarize()`, it is important you remember how to use these two commands

  * For `ggplot2`, you should definitely be able to make histograms (including how to convert it into a PMF, how to adjust bin size, etc.) scatter plots, and you should also know how to use the `color = variable` and `fill = variable` inputs for `aes()` and how to use `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()`

* Spend time looking at the cheat sheets so that you can efficiently use it to look up information

* Review slides from the first two weeks of classes, and chapters 3 and 5 in the *R for Data Science* textbook
