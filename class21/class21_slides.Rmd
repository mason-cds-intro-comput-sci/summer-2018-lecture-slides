# Model selection

---

# Question, what kind of model is best?

* Comparing residuals can help us understand the relative performance of models
--
, but it's just a qualitative measure

--

* How should we compare and rank models?

--

* This is what model selection is about, computing scores and measures of model performance for different models, and selecting the best choice.

--

* Bootstrapping is one option

--

* Cross-validation is another method that can compare relative model performance using only training data 

--

* A popular flavor of cross-validation (especially among data scientists) is called **k-fold cross-validation**

--

* **Basic idea:** Estimate how robust your model is by systematically removing different chunks (the "folds") of the dataset, repeating the fitting process, then testing its predictive power on the folds

| model   | Model to cross-validate written in `lm()` syntax                          |
