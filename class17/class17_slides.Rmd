# Annoucements

.font90[
* Midterm reports and presentation slides due by the start of class on Thursday, June 14th

  * Each group's presentation must be given tomorrow and it cannot be made up, being absent results in an automatic zero for the presentation part of your project grade

* Written responses (not questions) to Reading 14 (to be posted) due on **June 15** by 9:00am

  * Last reading that requires you to post on Slack after completing it

* Homework 3 due by **11:59pm on Friday, June 13th**

* Homework 4 to be posted soon, will be due by **11:59pm on Wednesday, June 20th**

* Homework 5 will also be posted soon and will be an **optional extra credit assignment** also due by **11:59pm on Wednesday, June 20th**

  * Homework 4 must be submitted before you can turn in Homework 5

* Details for Final will be discussed tomorrow after the Midterm Project presentations

# On the midterm project presentations

.valign-slide[
* Presentation order

  * I flipped a coin, Team 1 goes first, then Team 2

* Equipment

  * Students usually like to use one of their own laptops for the presentation
  
  * Make sure you bring any video adaptors you might need for HDMI or VGA outputs
  
  * My laptop is available: Powerpoint slides will be uploaded and presented using Powerpoint Online

# On the midterm project presentations

* Reminder of expectations

  * Review the midterm project instructions for details such as presentation length and what to discuss
  
  * Each group member is expected to speak an approximately equal amount of time
  
  * **The slides must look uniform and all content from every group member must be in a single Powerpoint/Google Slides file**
  
  * Figures from `ggplot2` should be saved as PNG files using `ggsave()` and then imported into the slideshow
  
  * Tables should be in the presentation software's native format

* You will fill out a brief form I give to you to evaluate the other team's presentation

* Class will continue after the presentations, which should not take up more than the first half hour of the class

# Margin of error

```{r pew4, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/pew4.png")
```

*   41% ± 2.9%: We are 95% confident that 38.1% to 43.9% of the public believe young adults, rather than middle-aged or older adults, are having the toughest time in today's economy.

*   49% ± 4.4%: We are 95% confident that 44.6% to 53.4% of 18–34 years olds have taken a job they didn't want just to pay the bills.

---

# Parameter estimation

*   We are often interested in **population parameters**.

--

*   Since complete populations are difficult (or impossible) to collect data on, we use **sample statistics** as **point estimates** for the unknown population parameters of interest.

--

*   Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.

--

*   Quantifying how sample statistics vary provides a way to estimate the **margin of error** associated with our point estimate.

--

*   But before we get to quantifying the variability among samples, let's try to understand how and why point estimates vary from sample to sample.

--

.qa[
Suppose we randomly sample 1,000 adults from each state in the US.
Would you expect the sample means of their heights to be the same, somewhat different, or very different?

.answer[Not the same, but only somewhat different.]

* A plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a **confidence interval**.
]

.font90[
* Using only a sample statistic to estimate a parameter is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net.

.pull-right[
```{r net-fishing-figure, echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%"}

.font80[
If we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish.

--

.font90[
* By analogy, if we report a point estimate (such as the mean or median), we probably won't hit the exact population parameter.
]

--

.font90[
* If we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter.

Do the data allow us to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis?
