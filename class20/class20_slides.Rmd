# Linear models in the tidyverse

---

# Last time...

--

* We used the `sim1` dataset loaded via `library(modelr)` and used `geom_smooth()` with `method = "lm"` to show what the linear model will look like

--

```{r sim1-smooth-plot, out.width = "60%"}
ggplot(sim1) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y), method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

# Method for plotting our model

* The following is a basic recipe for visualizing our models

--

* Create a series of `x` values with `data_grid()`:

```{r sim1-grid}
grid <- data_grid(sim1, x)
```

--

```{r sim1-grid-html, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
head(grid) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

---

# Extract predictions and residuals

--

* Use `add_predictions()` to import predictions into your tibble

--

```{r sim1-lm-predictions}
grid2 <- add_predictions(grid, sim1_mod)
```

--

* Use `add_residuals()` to extract the residuals from your fit.

--

```{r sim1-lm-residuals}
sim1_resid <- add_residuals(sim1, sim1_mod)
```

---

# Visualize the full model

* Create a plot:

--

```{r sim1-line-plot}
ggplot(sim1) +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = pred), data = grid2, color = "red", size = 1)
```

---

# Inspect the residuals

* Use `geom_histogram()` to inspect the absolute residuals.

--

```{r sim1-lm-residuals-histogram}
ggplot(sim1_resid) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = resid), binwidth = 1)
```

---

# Are the residuals normal?

* The residuals should be nearly normal.

--

* A good test for normal residuals is a Q-Q plot:

--

.code80[
```r
ggplot(sim1_resid) +
  geom_qq(aes(sample = resid)) +
  geom_qq_line(aes(sample = resid))
```
]

---

count: false

# Are the residuals normal?

* The residuals should be nearly normal.

```{r sim1-lm-residuals-qqplot, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(sim1_resid) +
  geom_qq(aes(sample = resid)) +
  geom_qq_line(aes(sample = resid))
```

---

# Residual spread

* Inspect the residual spread as a function of `x` to check whether the variability is constant or not:

--

```{r}
ggplot(sim1_resid) +
  geom_ref_line(h = 0) +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = resid))
```

# Case study: Mario Kart eBay prices dataset

---

# Machine Learning and prediction


--

* Machine Learning models are built with the purpose of making predictions

--

* The model is "trained" on a dataset and "learns" how to reproduce the general structure and features in that dataset

--

* In the best case scenario, you get a model with strong predictive powers that can take a series of inputs and generate a highly accurate output

--

* Generally only interested in accuracy, not understanding, making **prediction** distinct from **inference**

--

* This accuracy comes at a price, as the most accurate prediction models are frequently the most complicated

--

* This is what people mean when they say that Machine Learning algorithms are like a "black box"

# Data exploration

---

# What's in this dataset?

--

* What are the first several entries of the *Mario Kart* dataset?

--

```r
mariokart %>%
  glimpse()
```

--

.code80[
```{r mariokart-table, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
mariokart %>%
  glimpse()
```
]

---

# Exploring the response variable

* What is the shape and center of the response variable `totalPr`?

--

```{r mariokart-totalPr-with-outliers}
ggplot(mariokart) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = totalPr, fill = cond),
    position = "identity", alpha = 0.5, binwidth = 5, center = 0
  )
```

---

# Exploring the response variable

* A box plot is nice to use for exploration as well

```{r mariokart-totalPr-with-outliers-boxplot}
ggplot(mariokart) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cond, y = totalPr))
```

---

# Find the outliers

--

* What are the outliers?

--

* Filter the dataset to isolate them

--

```r
mariokart %>%
  filter(totalPr > 100) %>%
  glimpse()
```

.code70[
```{r mariokart-totalPr-explore-outliers, echo = FALSE}
mariokart %>%
  filter(totalPr > 100) %>%
  glimpse()
```
]

---

# Inspect outlier characteristics

--

* Look at the listing titles

--

```r
mariokart %>%
  filter(totalPr > 100) %>%
  select(title) %>%
  head()
```

```{r mariokart-totalPr-outliers-titles, echo = FALSE}
mariokart %>%
  filter(totalPr > 100) %>%
  select(title) %>%
  head() %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

--

* These are bundled items, not like the rest of the items in the dataset.

--

* Let's remove the outliers

--

* For simplicity, we will also restrict ourselves to a subset of variables: `cond`, `stockPhoto`, `duration`, and `wheels`

---

# Removing outliers

```{r mariokart-filter-outliers-select-cols}
mariokart2 <- mariokart %>%
  filter(totalPr <= 100) %>%
  select(totalPr, cond, stockPhoto, duration, wheels)
```

--

* Let's check the box plot again, this time with no outliers

--

```{r mariokart-totalPr-no-outliers-boxplot, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(mariokart2) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cond, y = totalPr))
```

---

# Looking for trends

* Continue exploring the dataset to find trends: does game condition and using a stock photo affect the total price?

--

.code70[
```{r mariokart-cond-stockPhoto-histogram, out.width = "65%"}
ggplot(mariokart2) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(totalPr, fill = cond), position = "identity",
    alpha = 0.5, center = 0, binwidth = 2
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~stockPhoto)
```
]

---

# Looking for trends

* A box plot would also be an appropriate way to show this data:

```{r mariokart-cond-stockPhoto-boxplot, out.width = "65%"}
ggplot(mariokart2) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cond, y = totalPr)) +
  facet_wrap(~stockPhoto)
```

---

# Data distribution of `totalPr`

--

* Is `totalPr` nearly normal?

--

* How does the distribution shape change within categories?

--

* Use Q-Q plot to check `totalPr` by itself:

--

```r
ggplot(mariokart2) +
  geom_qq(mapping = aes(sample = totalPr)) +
  geom_qq_line(mapping = aes(sample = totalPr))
```

```{r mariokart-totalPr-qq-plot, out.width = "65%", echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(mariokart2) +
  geom_qq(mapping = aes(sample = totalPr)) +
  geom_qq_line(mapping = aes(sample = totalPr))
```

---

# `totalPr` distribution within groups

* Q-Q plot with `totalPr` split by game condition:

--

```{r mariokart-totalPr-cond-qq-plot}
ggplot(mariokart2) +
  geom_qq(mapping = aes(sample = totalPr, color = cond)) +
  geom_qq_line(mapping = aes(sample = totalPr, color = cond))
```

---

# `totalPr` distribution within groups

* Q-Q plot with `totalPr` split by game condition and faceted by `stockPhoto`:

```{r mariokart-totalPr-cond-stockPhoto-qq-plot}
ggplot(mariokart2) +
  geom_qq(mapping = aes(sample = totalPr, color = cond)) +
  geom_qq_line(mapping = aes(sample = totalPr, color = cond)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ stockPhoto)
```

---

# Categorical variables in scatterplots

* What happens if we plot `totalPr` as a function of `cond`, a categorical variable?

--

```{r mariokart-totalPr-cond-scatterplot}
ggplot(mariokart2) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(cond, totalPr), size = 3, alpha = 0.7)
```

---

# Categorical variables in scatterplots

* It's easier to see the points if we jitter them

```{r mariokart-totalPr-cond-scatterplot-jitter}
ggplot(mariokart2) +
  geom_jitter(
    mapping = aes(cond, totalPr), size = 3, alpha = 0.7, width = 0.25,
    height = 0.25)
```

# Training and testing datasets

---

# Split dataset 80/20

--

* Frequently, it's good practice to split a dataset prior to testing a model.

--

* The following code splits the data into two partitions

--

```{r mariokart-train-test-split}
mariokart_with_ids <- mariokart2 %>%
 bind_cols(id = 1:nrow(mariokart2))

train <- mariokart_with_ids %>%
  sample_frac(size = 0.80, replace = FALSE)

test  <- mariokart_with_ids %>%
  anti_join(train, by = 'id')
```

--

* 80% is randomly selected and placed in the training dataset

--
  
* Remaining 20% is used for the testing dataset

--

* All subsequent model building will be done using the `train` dataset

---

class: middle, center, inverse

# Univariate linear regression models

---

# Predict using game condition

* Let's start with a refresher on creating a univariate linear model using `lm()`

--

* Build a model that uses the `cond` categorical variable to predict the total price `totalPr`

--

```{r mariokart-model-cond}
mariokart_cond_model_lm <- lm(totalPr ~ cond, data = train)
```

--

* Predict training dataset and compute the residuals

--

```{r mariokart-model-cond-predict-resid}
mariokart_cond_model_df <- train %>%
  add_predictions(mariokart_cond_model_lm) %>%
  add_residuals(mariokart_cond_model_lm)
