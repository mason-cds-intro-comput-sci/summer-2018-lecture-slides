# `tidyr` package continued

---

# `tidyr` verbs

* `gather()`: transforms wide data to narrow data

* `spread()`: transforms narrow data to wide data

* `separate()`: make multiple columns out of a single column

* `unite()`: make a single column out of multiple columns

# `spread()` example

Untidy data frame stored in `table2`

.font80[
```{r untidy-table2, echo = FALSE}

  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

# `spread()` example

```r

  spread(key = type, value = count)
```

```{r tidy-up-table2, echo = FALSE}
table2 %>%
  spread(key = type, value = count) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

# `separate()` example

Untidy data frame stored in `table3`

```{r untidy-table3, echo = FALSE}
table3 %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")

---

# `separate()` example

```r
table3 %>%
  separate(

    into = combine("cases", "population")
  )

```{r tidy-up-table3, echo = FALSE}
table3 %>%

# `separate()` example

```r

*   sep = "/",              # Set the separating symbol
  )

# `unite()` example

Untidy data frame stored in `table5`

```{r untidy-table5, echo = FALSE}
table5 %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

---

# `unite()` example

```r
table5 %>%

# `unite()` example

```r

  mutate(new = as.integer(new)) %>%   #  Change data type to integer
  rename(year = new)                  #  Rename column to year

# Tidy gradebook dataset exercise

.vhalign-slide[
Download the Github Classroom repo [linked in channel .mono[\#su18-a01-activities] on Slack](https://masoncds101.slack.com/messages/GATUBQDJA) and complete the following exercises:

1. Make the dataset tidy using either `gather()` or `spread()`. The tidy gradebook should have one observation per row, which gives all the grades a student has received for the different assignments in the semester.

2. Use the tidy gradebook and create a histogram that answers the question, "What was the grade distribution for the Midterm Exam?"

Remember to commit and push your work!
