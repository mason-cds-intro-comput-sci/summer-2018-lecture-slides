.qa[Based on the following scatterplot, which of the following statements is correct about the head and skull lengths of possums?]

```{r possum-head-skull, out.width = "45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/possum_head_skull.svg")
```

1.  There is no relationship between head length and skull width, i.e. the variables are independent.
2.  Head length and skull width are positively associated.}
3.  Skull width and head length are negatively associated.
4.  A longer head causes the skull to be wider.
5.  A wider skull causes the head to be longer.
--

.answer[Head length and skull width are positively associated.]

---

# Associated vs. independent

*   When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called **associated** variables.

    *   Associated variables can also be called **dependent** variables and vice-versa.

*   If two variables are not associated, i.e. there is no evident connection between the two, then they are said to be **independent**.

# Examining numerical data

# Dot plots

.valign-slide[
Useful for visualizing one numerical variable. Darker colors represent areas where there are more observations.

```{r gpa-dot-plot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/gpa_dot_plot.svg")
```

.qa[
How would you describe the distribution of GPAs in this data set?
Make sure to say something about the center, shape, and spread of the distribution.

---

# Dot plots & mean

.valign-slide[
```{r gpa-dot-plot-mean, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/gpa_dot_plot_mean.svg")
```

* The **mean**, also called the **average** (marked with a triangle in the above plot), is one way to measure the center of a **distribution** of data.

* The mean GPA is 3.59.
]

---

# Mean

.valign-slide.latex[
* The **sample mean**, denoted as $\mathbf{\bar{x}}$, can be calculated as
  $$\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n},$$
  where $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ represent the **n** observed values.

* The **population mean** is also computed the same way but is denoted as $\mathbf{\mu}$.
  It is often not possible to calculate $\mu$ since population data are rarely available.

* The sample mean is a **sample statistic**, and serves as a **point estimate** of the population mean.
  This estimate may not be perfect, but if the sample is good (representative of the population), it is usually a pretty good estimate.

# Histograms and shape

---

# Histograms &mdash; Extracurricular hours

* Histograms provide a view of the **data density**.
  Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common.

* Histograms are especially convenient for describing the **shape** of the data distribution.

* The chosen **bin width** can alter the story the histogram is telling.

```{r extracurr-hrs-hist, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/extracurr_hrs_hist.svg")
```

# Bin width

Which one(s) of these histograms are useful? Which reveal too much about the data? Which hide too much?

# Poor visualizations may lead to tragedy

*   The *Challenger* disaster, January 28th, 1986

--

*   The Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds into flight, all seven crew members died

--

*   The rubber O-rings, which held the rockets together, had failed due to the low temperatures (below 30°F)

--

*   Engineers at Morton Thiokol, who supplied solid rocket motors to NASA, warned about this on January 27th, 1986 in a conference call

--

*   NASA and the managers at Morton Thiokol overruled their concerns, unpersuaded by the engineers

# *How to Lie with Statistics*

*   Book by Darrell Huff, published in 1954

--

*   Aside: The title is tongue-in-cheek and is usually misunderstood. The book is not about "fudging the numbers" with statistics.

--

*   Illustrates ways that visualizations can be manipulated such that they are misleading, but technically show accurate information

--

*   **General method:** Violate conventions and expectations

---

# .font90[Example 1: gun deaths in Florida over time]

*   Context: Florida passed a "Stand Your Ground" law in 2005

--

*   Advocates claimed it would reduce crime, opponents argued it would increase use of lethal force

--

*   If you wanted to use data to answer this question, and you came across this graphic published by the news organization Reuters, what would you conclude?

# .font60[Side note: How do we have a record going back to the 1880s?]

.valign-slide[
Temperatures from the 1800s and onward were recorded using thermometers at various locations around the globe, and by the 1880s thermometers had become precise.
Systematic measurements began around the mid-1800s at various army posts, and in 1891 the National Weather Service was formed to continue the effort.

# .font80[Principles and ethics for scientific visualizations]

1.  Present your results transparently and honestly

--

2.  Show all data, including outliers, that are valid measurements

--

3.  Use graph layouts that show trends and lets readers easily read quantitative values

--

4.  Do not break conventions regarding scaling, axis orientation, the type of plot to use, etc.

--

5.  If you leave something out of a visualization, say so and justify it

--

6.  Strongly consider including your datasets and any scripts used to create figures with your reports or journal articles
