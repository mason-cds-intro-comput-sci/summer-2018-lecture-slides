# Confidence intervals wrap-up

---

# What does 95% confident mean?

* Suppose we generated a series of bootstrap distributions with `infer` and found the 95% confidence interval for each one

--

* Let's also assume that, for one reason or another, we somehow knew the value of the true population mean

--

* Then, the phrase "95% confident" means that about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population mean

--

.pull-left[
* The figure shows this process with 25 samples, where 24 of the resulting confidence intervals contain the true average number of exclusive relationships, and one does not.

.pull-right[
```{r confidence-interval-visual, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/95PercentConfidenceInterval.svg")
```

# Width of an interval

.qa[
If we want to be more certain that we capture the population parameter, i.e. increase our confidence level, should we use a wider interval or a smaller interval?
]

--

.answer[A wider interval.]

--

.qa[
Can you see any drawbacks to using a wider interval?

```{r garfield-comic, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/garfield.png")
```

.answer[If the interval is too wide it may not be very informative.]

--

* Commonly used confidence levels in practice are 90%, 95%, 98%, and 99%.

---

# Effect size

* We would like to know how significant a result is, not just whether or not we can reject the null hypothesis.

--

* The **effect size** measures the relative difference between two distributions.

--

* One effect size definition: [Cohen's *d*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen.27s_d)

--
    
| Effect size | d    |
| ----------- | ---- |
| Very small  | 0.01 |
| Small       | 0.20 |
| Medium      | 0.50 |
| Large       | 0.80 |
| Very large  | 1.20 |
| Huge        | 2.00 |

--

* Guided instructions on how to use it on Homework 4!
